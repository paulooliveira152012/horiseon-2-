# Horiseon 

## Explanation and Result

* The goal for this project was to improve the semantic structure, accessibility features and css commenting of the given page to better optimize the deployiment of the webpage, and improve user experience and website mantaincance.

* I started with a given webpage already functioning, however, not semanticly structured, lacking accessibility atributes as well as lacking discriptive comments in the css properties and a appropriate README file.

* My first apporach was to replace all div tags in the HTML file with the semantic tags accordingly with its equivalent relevance and reordered the nasting flow of elements in a more appropriate way. 

* Then I added "alt" attributes to the images including the images' descriptions in it for a fallback option in the event the image fails to open and/or accecibility features are being required for users to have a better experience while visiting the webpage.

* At first, I was going to change the h3's contained in the "aside" section of the page to a more semantic heading, h2 since it's nested in a main h1. however, I was intructed by the leave it as it is because that's that's what's in the solution.

* Since the CSS properties were lacking discriptive commenting, I added comments to all CSS properties to better understand each reference. 

* Since the project was missing an appropriate README file, I created a new one including the main changes I noticed that needed to be implemeted, as well as adding what was lacking such as CSS comments and acccecibility attributes.

* Some of the challenges I faced was understanding deciding how to use the `alt` attributes in a more accessible way, identifying the selector type for each element in the HTML structure, and submiting the project the right way which included the right links in the right places for reference.
