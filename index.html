            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

<!--
    - I changed all the div tags that have sematic equivalent tags to its semantic tag.
    - I checked to make sure the element tags are positioned in hierarchy order such as main > sections > aside nesting appropriately.
    - I have added alt atributes as well as description to all applicablle images for hearing accessibility.
    - I was going to chage the h3s under the aside section to h2s because they are not nested in a h2, but a h1; but I was told to leave it as it is because that's that's what's in the solution.
